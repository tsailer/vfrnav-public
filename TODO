- speed
- correctness / valgrind
- trackeditor:
  - find names for depature / destination from db
  - export to KML
  - make waypoint from track point
  - determine times from track

FlightDeck:
- Flight Plan Import/Export
- IFVU Flight Plan validation
- Terrain Cut graphics

Bugs:
- QNH inconsistent (between dialog and indicator)
- check airspace display
- check airway display
- get bluetooth GPS working

Autorouter:
- try to extract "SID"/"STAR" from standard routes
